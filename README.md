# BirdSighter
### Built with vanilla Javascript and Ruby on Rails 

BirdSpotter was born from an interest in finding extracurricular activities during the pandemic lockdown. Bird watching seemed to be surprinsingly enjoyable so I decided to build my first vanilla JS project to empower me to record my bird watching activity. [Demo video can be viewed here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODzlbJ79Mmw).
